# About
A worms-like game created as the final game for my Unity3D course. This version of the project doesn't contain any preprocessing and the hook mechanic isn't amazing.

- The first player to eliminate all the opponent's worms wins

# Features
- Procedurally generated map using Perlin noise
- Destructible terrain
- 3 different map tiles
- One weapon (bazooka) and a hook to move around the map
- Wind system affecting bullet trajectory
- Mines exploding when a worm gets too close
